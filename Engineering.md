# Consulting Roles - Engineering Branch

These roles start after Senior Developer, as a more technically-focused career path.

## Senior Engineer
> I am a senior developer with a specific technical speciality, an architect and a problem solver. I am the go-to person in my technology area. I represent the technical brilliance that Readify brings to the market.

This is a proposed role. We'll need to flesh out the details of it here yet.

It's intended to be overall roughly equivalent to Senior Consultant, but with more of an engineering focus.
